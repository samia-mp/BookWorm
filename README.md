# BookWorm
CISC4900 project
BookWorm is aimed to be a web application where the user is able to use a search engine to find a book they’re interested in by title, ISBN number or author. It will also allow users to read a brief description of the book, label books as favorites, rate books, leave reviews, create an account and link them to e-commerce sites where they’ll be able to purchase books. Bookworm’s objective is to provide users with an easy and seamless user interface for long-time readers or beginners to dive into the world of literature. 
	The design for this project begins with wireframes: home page/query page, log in page, sign up page, results page/query page, selected book page, commenting and rating page and account page. There will be an ERD upcoming to show the relationships between the users, their books labeled as favorites, passwords and usernames. The technical implementation for BookWorm will begin the front-end development using html, css and javascript and later implement a database to store the favorite books, comments, usernames and passwords of users. Google Books API will be used to add functionality to the search query page.
