# BookWorm

CISC4900 project
BookWorm is aimed to be a web application where the user is able to use a search engine to find a book they’re interested in by title, ISBN number or author. It will also allow users to read a preview of the book, link them to e-commerce sites where they’ll be able to purchase books, label books as favorites and rate books. Bookworm’s objective is to provide users with an easy and seamless user interface for long-time readers or beginners to dive into the world of literature.
The design for this project begins with wireframes: home page/query page, preview page, results page/query page, Your Favorites page. The technical implementation for BookWorm will begin the front-end development using html, css and javascript, the font awaseome toolkit & the wick editor are used animations and the Google Books API will be used to add functionality to the home/search page.
