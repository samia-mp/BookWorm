        What's the difference between double equals vs tripple equals?
        Double equals: check value only, it will convert the elementsbeing compared to the same type and compare values only.
        Tripple : checks type and value, if type and value isnt the same then when compared they will be evaluated as false.

        let num = '5';
        let num2 = 5;
        console.log(num2 === num ); // FALSE
        console.log(num2 == num); // TRUE

        //IN CONCLUSION, it is better to use tripple equals as it will save time from fixing bugs, and use double equals when there is a strong use case (for example when an API can interpret both a string and number based on value).
