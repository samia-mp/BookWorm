        Let: let variables are block scoped, meaning it is accessible within a section of code in {}. You can update let variables but not redeclare them within their scope, meaning if a variable with the same name is declared outside the scope there will be no error.

        What is hoisting in let? A mechanism where let declarations are pushed to the top of their scope, however they are not initialized(unlike var, where they are initialized as undefined) therefore if you try to use a variable or function before their declaration then you will get a reference error.*/
